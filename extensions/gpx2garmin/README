Summary:

gpx2garmin is a pytrainer (https://github.com/pytrainer/pytrainer) extension that will export the current record's gpx track to a garmin device.

Requirements:

gbsbabel - http://www.gpsbabel.org/

(typically installable via your repository) 

Usage:

1) Plug your device in via USB, switch it on.
2) Click the 'Export to device' button = export to garmin device!

Caveats:

- Some (all?) devices will truncate the track because they only support a
  limited amount of track points. The extension can (via gpsbabel) simplify a
  track using the limit supplied by the user. Beware of track changes (e.g.
  sharp bends on the map may show the trace cutting corners)!
- Track names aren't part of the track data so are added by the extension from
  the metadata. Some devices, however, truncate the name (e.g. biking2010-08-23
  > biking2010-08) so rename tracks where necessary. 

You may also need to fix the device permissions as documented here:
